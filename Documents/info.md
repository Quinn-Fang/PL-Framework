## Background

What most programming language does is translate high-level (human-readable) language to low-level machine codes. Most works on programming languages are optimizing the translating process to produce high-performance machine codes. However, most of the time, they are not the best way to express your logic. For instance, most people understand English, but few understand Java or C++. 
Even for natural languages themselves, like English,  there are different ways of expressing your ideas, in different scenarios, under different contexts. Some people are better at communicating,
they can speak more understandable English and make people understand more clearly, Some terms are better than others in your specific domain. 
We need a way to write our code in a more understandable way, meaning using the terms we are comfortable with, and ignoring some background information that is supposed to be obvious under the context. But also the ability to implement it, and fill in the details missing so the language we are comfortable with is also interpretable to the target, most of the time, computer.
