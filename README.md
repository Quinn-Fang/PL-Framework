# Quinne

Quinne is a golang grammared programming language framework, making it possible to create your own simple, customized, context-specific programming language  with a focus on being:
* *Light*: Minimal dependencies (Antlr4 golang target mostly)
* *Simpler*: Deal with essential parts of a program only (how if-else expression should be judged, how functions should be run, etc...) without worrying about most compiler details that need to be done but not closely related to what you what to express in a specific context with the program grammar that you specified.
